    "If you want to sort things in some order other than the “natural” or its reverse, you can provide an additional parameter, the key parameter. For example, suppose you want to sort a list of numbers based on their absolute value, so that -4 comes after 3? Or suppose you have a dictionary with strings as the keys and numbers as the values. Instead of sorting them in alphabetic order based on the keys, you might like to sort them in order based on their values.\n",

    "What’s really going on there? We’ve done something pretty strange. Before, all the values we have passed as parameters have been pretty easy to understand: numbers, strings, lists, Booleans, dictionaries. Here we have passed a function object: absolute is a variable name whose value is the function. When we pass that function object, it is not automatically invoked. Instead, it is just bound to the formal parameter key of the function sorted.\n",

When a value is provided for that parameter in an invocation of the function sorted, it has to be a function. What the sorted function does is call that key function once for each item in the list that’s getting sorted. It associates the result returned by that function (the absolute function in our case) with the original value. Think of those associated values as being little post-it notes that decorate the original values. The value 4 has a post-it note that says 4 on it, but the value -2 has a post-it note that says 2 on it. Then the sorted function rearranges the original items in order of the values written on their associated post-it notes.\n",
